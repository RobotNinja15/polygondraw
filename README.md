# Polygon Drawer For 2D Coordinates

I was working on a P5.js project and I had a hard time trying to use coordinates to draw 2D shapes because I could not accurately determine where I wanted the shapes to be on my canvas(1920 by 1080), so This makes it easier for anyone to visualize the 2D shapes and also what coordinates they could use for positioning those shapes.

## Features

- Interactive drawing of polygons with left-click to add vertices and right-click to draw the polygon.
- Display of coordinates alongside each vertex(Nice).
- Simple and intuitive user interface.
